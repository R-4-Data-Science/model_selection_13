Description: Implements a multi-path stepwise model selection procedure using 
    the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Instead of following a single 
    forward-selection path, the method explores multiple near-optimal model 
    sequences by retaining all children models whose AIC values are within a 
    specified tolerance of the best model at each step. Model stability is 
    assessed through repeated resampling (bootstrap or subsampling), recording 
    how often each predictor appears across the model sets. The package then 
    identifies plausible final models based on both AIC closeness and the 
    average stability of their selected predictors. Supports linear and 
    logistic regression.
