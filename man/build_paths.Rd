\usage{
build_paths(
  x,
  y,
  family = c("gaussian", "binomial"),
  K = min(ncol(x), 10),
  eps = 1e-06,
  delta = 1,

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Matrix or data.frame of predictors (n x p).}

\item{y}{Response vector of length n.}

\item{family}{Model family: "gaussian" (lm) or "binomial" (glm).}

\item{K}{Maximum number of forward steps (max model size).}

\item{eps}{Minimum AIC improvement required to expand from a parent.}

\item{delta}{AIC tolerance for keeping near-tie child models (per parent).}

\item{L}{Maximum number of models to keep per level (after deduplication).}
}
\value{
A list of class "path_forest" with components:
  - frontiers: list of data.frames, one per step, describing models at that step.
  - aic_by_model: data.frame summarizing all models across all steps.
  - meta: list with input parameters and variable names.
}
\description{
Builds a small "forest" of alternative forward-selection paths by
allowing near-ties in AIC at each step.
