\usage{
plot_heatmap(
  plaus,
  reorder = TRUE,
  main = "Overlap Heatmap of Plausible Models",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plaus}{A data.frame returned by \code{plausible_models()}, containing
at least a list-column \code{vars} with the predictors in each model.}

\item{reorder}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), rows/cols are reordered
by hierarchical clustering on (1 - similarity). If \code{FALSE}, models
are kept in their current order.}

\item{main}{Title for the plot.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to \code{image()}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the Jaccard similarity matrix.
}
\description{
Plot a heatmap of pairwise overlaps between plausible models, measured by
Jaccard similarity between sets of predictors.
