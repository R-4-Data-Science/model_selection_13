\usage{
plot_heatmap(
  plaus,
  reorder = TRUE,
  main = "Overlap Heatmap of Plausible Models",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plaus}{A data.frame returned by \code{plausible_models()}, containing
at least a list-column \code{vars} with the predictors in each model.}

\item{reorder}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), rows/columns are
hierarchically clustered and reordered by similarity. If \code{FALSE},
models are kept in their current order.}

\item{main}{Character string: title for the heatmap.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{stats::heatmap()}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the Jaccard similarity matrix used for plotting.
}
\description{
Plot a heatmap of pairwise overlaps between plausible models,
typically obtained from \code{plausible_models()}. The overlap is measure
using the Jaccard similarity between sets of predictors:
\deqn{J(S_i, S_j) = |S_i \cap S_j| / |S_i \cup S_j|.}

This visualization helps to see which plausible models are almost identical
(high overlap) and which provide genuinely different combinations of
predictors.
